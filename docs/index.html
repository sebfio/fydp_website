			</div>
			Provisioning servers on DigitalOcean like a king is one thing, but let&rsquo;s be honest: default installations don&rsquo;t provide a lot of security. So I&rsquo;ve spent some time to manage the security on my provisioned boxes. This post (and probably the next as well) will show you how I used SaltStack to secure my infrastructure.
The goal  Given the master/minion set-up from the previous posts, I want to have a running firewall which:

				<a href="/fydp_website/posts/infra-as-repo-separating-master-from/">Infra as a Repo: Separating the Master from the Minion</a>
			</div>
			Life can be good. After my previous success in provisioning a master/minion set-up, the next logical step was to introduce a separate master VM. This post explains how I did it. It will be a relatively short post, because it turned out to be ridiculously easy.
The goal  Given the current single-server master/minion setup, I want to recreate the same situation with two different machines: one Salt master which only functions as a Salt master, and one Salt minion that runs Nginx.

			After I managed to provision an Nginx server using a masterless Salt setup, I felt it was time to introduce a master. This proved to be a frustrating challenge, but in the end I managed to do it. This post describes how I did it. It might save you some time.
The goal  Given the current single-server setup, I want to reach the exact same result using a Salt master.

			I believe that managing your infrastructure can and should be fun. Recently I have been toying around with Vagrant and Salt Stack to make this a reality. This weekend, I managed to combine these tools to automatically provision a new Nginx server on Digital Ocean.
This in itself is nothing new - the interesting part is where I have published the entire script as a Github repository without sacrificing any security.

			</div>
			For some time, I&rsquo;ve been keeping a small website called ZooWizard. It&rsquo;s main purpose: to have an outlet for two of my main hobbies: visiting zoos and programming.
One of the problems with keeping this website up to date is the secondary data, i.e. data about zoos and animals. Until now, this data has been sourced using Wikipedia, personal experience and of course: lot&rsquo;s of manual data entry.
This was nice for a while because it&rsquo;s a great way to get started, but for some time this manual aspect has been getting on my nerves.

			Our Tower Defense game is slowly turning into a real game, but there is still a lot of work to do. For example, most games are about winning, and therefore about losing. In this part of the tutorial I&rsquo;m going to work on losing the game. For now, winning will remain a promise :)

			In the previous post I allowed the player to place his own towers to shoot the enemies. This was a great step forward, but one thing was lacking: the satisfaction after the kill. Daniel Cook from LostGarden has a great article on feedback loops, and I want some of that.
So, in this post I will add some visual feedback on killing enemies, and introduce the concept of Scores.

			</div>
			Until now, my TD game has been a proof of concept, mainly concerned with programming. The end result so far has been something to look at, without any user interaction at all.
It&rsquo;s time to change this.
In this episode I will give the player the possibility to add towers on predefined spots. You will learn something about gaming trade-offs and GUI programming.

			</div>
			Up until now, my towers have been somewhat stupid: enemies were only shot when they first approached the tower. After that, the enemies could have a picnic in front of said tower without anything happening. In real life Tower Defense combat situations this is of course unacceptable.
In this part, I will modify my towers to regularly shoot at enemies within range, just like real TD games. I will introduce list attributes, strategies and a bit of custom code.

			So far my towers have been shooting at enemies with invisible death rays. This is of course state-of-the-art weaponry, but most players prefer a bit of feedback.
In this part, I will replace the invisible death rays by animated bullets. Along the way, you might learn a bit about basic game mathematics.

			In the previous posts, I created a very basic Tower Defense Game with wandering enemies and pre-placed towers that can kill enemies. In most TD games, enemies are not killed outright but damaged. In this part, I will introduce the pre-shipped Health Manager and use it to make the towers deal damage.
I will also create a new behavior to show visual feedback on damage. This will include the concept of &ldquo;Run later&rdquo; blocks which can be very very tricky.

Towers Towers are the heart of any Tower Defense game. The player places them at strategical positions on the battle field.

In this part, I will create a simple scene with wandering enemies. I will introduce a custom behavior and use some preshipped behaviors to make it seem like a &ldquo;real&rdquo; game.

			This weekend, I have migrated my Google AppEngine application Zoo Wizard from JPA to Objectify. This post gives a short overview of my rationale and the steps I&rsquo;ve taken to complete this migration.
Spoiler: moving to Objectify is a good move, and apart from some differences between @Embeddable in JPA and Objectify, the transition went smoothly.
Rationale When I first created the application, I opted to use the GAE JPA API to stay in my comfort zone.

			Making games is fun. But so is making money. My first game, Droppy Goes Home, is nearly finished, and it&rsquo;s time to prepare the next steps: publishing the game and becoming annoyingly rich in the process.
I&rsquo;ve never published a game before, but in the end, business is always the same. In order to make money, every business has to do two important things:
 Marketing – if people don&rsquo;t know your product, you will never make any money.
