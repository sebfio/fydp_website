			</div>
			Last week I talked explained how to lose. This week, I&rsquo;ll talk about winning. After a short introduction on what it means to win a Tower Defense level, the tutorial will explain how to have multiple waves and how to recognize that the player has won.
The result of this part can be seen here; you can also find it on StencylForge under the name &ldquo;Publysher – TD Tutorial part #10&rdquo;.

			</div>
			Our Tower Defense game is slowly turning into a real game, but there is still a lot of work to do. For example, most games are about winning, and therefore about losing. In this part of the tutorial I&rsquo;m going to work on losing the game. For now, winning will remain a promise :)

			</div>
			In the previous post I allowed the player to place his own towers to shoot the enemies. This was a great step forward, but one thing was lacking: the satisfaction after the kill. Daniel Cook from LostGarden has a great article on feedback loops, and I want some of that.
So, in this post I will add some visual feedback on killing enemies, and introduce the concept of Scores.

			</div>
			Until now, my TD game has been a proof of concept, mainly concerned with programming. The end result so far has been something to look at, without any user interaction at all.
It&rsquo;s time to change this.
In this episode I will give the player the possibility to add towers on predefined spots. You will learn something about gaming trade-offs and GUI programming.

			</div>
			Today it&rsquo;s time to change our enemies from harmless wandering puppets into goal-oriented path-following critters. I will introduce the concept of paths, following paths and spawning, and I will guide you through the creation of a new complex behavior.

The Art of Using Placeholder Art You might have frowned at the quality of the artwork so far.

			</div>
			Up until now, my towers have been somewhat stupid: enemies were only shot when they first approached the tower. After that, the enemies could have a picnic in front of said tower without anything happening. In real life Tower Defense combat situations this is of course unacceptable.
In this part, I will modify my towers to regularly shoot at enemies within range, just like real TD games. I will introduce list attributes, strategies and a bit of custom code.

			</div>
			So far my towers have been shooting at enemies with invisible death rays. This is of course state-of-the-art weaponry, but most players prefer a bit of feedback.
In this part, I will replace the invisible death rays by animated bullets. Along the way, you might learn a bit about basic game mathematics.

			</div>
			In the previous posts, I created a very basic Tower Defense Game with wandering enemies and pre-placed towers that can kill enemies. In most TD games, enemies are not killed outright but damaged. In this part, I will introduce the pre-shipped Health Manager and use it to make the towers deal damage.
I will also create a new behavior to show visual feedback on damage. This will include the concept of &ldquo;Run later&rdquo; blocks which can be very very tricky.

Towers Towers are the heart of any Tower Defense game. The player places them at strategical positions on the battle field.

			In this tutorial, I will show you how to create a simple Tower Defense game in StencylWorks. The version I will use is 2.0. This tutorial is aimed at people who have completed the crash courses on the StencylWorks website and have a basic understanding of how StencylWorks works.
In this part, I will create a simple scene with wandering enemies. I will introduce a custom behavior and use some preshipped behaviors to make it seem like a &ldquo;real&rdquo; game.
