			</div>
			Provisioning servers on DigitalOcean like a king is one thing, but let&rsquo;s be honest: default installations don&rsquo;t provide a lot of security. So I&rsquo;ve spent some time to manage the security on my provisioned boxes. This post (and probably the next as well) will show you how I used SaltStack to secure my infrastructure.
The goal  Given the master/minion set-up from the previous posts, I want to have a running firewall which:

				<a href="/fydp_website/posts/infra-as-repo-separating-master-from/">Infra as a Repo: Separating the Master from the Minion</a>
			</div>
			Life can be good. After my previous success in provisioning a master/minion set-up, the next logical step was to introduce a separate master VM. This post explains how I did it. It will be a relatively short post, because it turned out to be ridiculously easy.
The goal  Given the current single-server master/minion setup, I want to recreate the same situation with two different machines: one Salt master which only functions as a Salt master, and one Salt minion that runs Nginx.

			After I managed to provision an Nginx server using a masterless Salt setup, I felt it was time to introduce a master. This proved to be a frustrating challenge, but in the end I managed to do it. This post describes how I did it. It might save you some time.
The goal  Given the current single-server setup, I want to reach the exact same result using a Salt master.

			</div>
			I believe that managing your infrastructure can and should be fun. Recently I have been toying around with Vagrant and Salt Stack to make this a reality. This weekend, I managed to combine these tools to automatically provision a new Nginx server on Digital Ocean.
This in itself is nothing new - the interesting part is where I have published the entire script as a Github repository without sacrificing any security.
